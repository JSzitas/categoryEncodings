# categoryEncodings

<!-- badges: start -->

**categoryEncodings** intends to provide a fast way to encode 'factor' or qualitative variables through various methods. The intended implementation is C++, but since writing an R implementation is orders of magnitude faster, the current implementation is a simple R API. This package and it's API is highly experimental and will change often. 

Currently there is no support for installing the package, but that will come soon - this is the initial implementation.
