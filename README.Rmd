**categoryEncodings** intends to provide a fast way to encode 'factor' or qualitative variables through various methods. The packages uses **data.table** as the backend for speed, with as few other dependencies as possible.

The current version features automatic inference of factors and uses a very simple heuristic for encoding, as well as manual controls. 

I hope to close in on version 1.0, and a *CRAN* release, rather shortly (late January 2019 at the very latest!).
