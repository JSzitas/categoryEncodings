**categoryEncodings** intends to provide a fast way to encode ‘factor’
or qualitative variables through various methods. The packages uses
**data.table** as the backend for speed, with as few other dependencies
as possible.

Currently there are functions one could use for working with factors on
a one-by-one basis. Support for automating this somewhat ardous task is
intended and incoming with the 1.0 release.
