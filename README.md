# categoryEncodings

<!-- badges: start -->

**categoryEncodings** intends to provide a fast way to encode ‘factor’
or qualitative variables through various methods. The intended
implementation is with the use of **data.table**, with as few other
dependencies as possible.

Currently there is no support for installing the package, but that will
come soon - this is the initial implementation.
